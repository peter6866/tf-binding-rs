A Rust library for predicting transcription factor (TF) binding site occupancy in DNA sequences. This toolkit provides efficient implementations for:

- FASTA file manipulation and sequence processing
- Position Weight Matrix (PWM) handling and Energy Weight Matrix (EWM) conversion
- TF binding site occupancy prediction using biophysical models
- Information content and binding site diversity calculations

Built with performance in mind, this library offers a fast and memory-efficient alternative to traditional Python implementations for genomic analysis.

## Features

- 🧬 Fast FASTA file reading and writing
- 📊 PWM/EWM-based binding site scoring
- 🔍 Efficient sequence scanning for binding sites
- 📈 Occupancy landscape calculation
- 🧮 Statistical and thermodynamic calculations

## Use Cases

- Genomic sequence analysis
- TF binding site prediction
- Regulatory sequence characterization
- High-throughput DNA sequence processing
